# Tweaking
* You may want to change the promot being sent to GPT3, I used: 'Respond to this email with a positive attitude, absolutely NEVER use any names. End with kind regards without a name:' to avoid any names.
* The sleep-timer are waiting for 20 minutes before checking again for new unread emails, this can be changed aswell!
* reply.Subject can be changed aswell, I'm Swedish so we use 'Sv: ' instead of 'Re: '
